        <h2>A wonderfully fluffy start to the day</h2>
        <p>Turn overripe, blackened bananas into sweet and fluffy American-style pancakes. Serve with syrup and crunchy, toasted pecan nuts as a delicious brunch treat.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 very ripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 medium eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>250ml whole milk</li>
            <li>Butter, for frying</li>
            <li>2 just ripe bananas, sliced</li>
            <li>Maple syrup (optional)</li>
            <li>Pecan halves, toasted and roughly chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sieve the flour, baking powder and a generous pinch of salt into a large bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, mash the very ripe bananas with a fork until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract and milk. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the wet ingredients and swiftly whisk together to create a smooth, silky batter.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a little knob of butter in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the pan and cook for several minutes, or until small bubbles start appearing on the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook for 1-2 mins on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven.
            </li>
            <li>Stack the pancakes on plates and top with the banana slices, a glug of sticky maple syrup and a handful of pecan nuts, if you like.
            </li>
        </ol>
